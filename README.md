## Steps

1. Created a GitHub repository.
2. Opened a Netlify account.
3. Linked the Netlify account to the GitHub repository.
4. Opened VSCode and cloned the repository locally:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Page-test.git
   cd Page-test
   ```
5. Added all files:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
6. Made the first commit:
   ```
   git commit -m 'first post'
   ```
7. Created `styles.css` and added it to the project.
8. Committed the CSS file:
   ```
   git commit -m 'add auto css'
   ```

## Deployed Page

You can view the deployed page here: [williambriand.netlify.app](https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app)

## Possible Next Steps

- Add more HTML pages and navigation links between them.
- Integrate a simple JavaScript script (e.g., a form validation or dynamic content).
- Create a favicon and include it in the `index.html`.
- Use SCSS or another CSS preprocessor for styling.
- Implement responsive design using media queries.
- Set up a custom domain on Netlify.
- Add continuous deployment with build settings on Netlify.
- Create a contact form and link it to a service like Netlify Forms or Formspree.
